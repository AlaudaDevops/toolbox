Given the (jira structure)(./jira-structure.md) adopted by our Project (DEVOPS)

After understanding the structure, I want you to read our roadmap document (draft) which is used to quickly make changes and to observe the whole picture: https://confluence.alauda.cn/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=276038031

I want you to focus in the roadmap for ACP 4.2 column. Each column inside the ACP 4.2 column represents a version of the component/plugin. The plugin name is written in the pillar column

Read all the epics and milestones in this document: https://confluence.alauda.cn/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=276037886

After that I want you read our current jira issues relatad to roadmap planning  (Pillars, Milestones, Epics) and create a list of changes that should be done in jira to reflect the changes in the roadmap document for me to review.

NOTE: Some epic names or milestones might have differences between confluence and jira data. Do your best to reuse existing issues and suggesting creation of new ones only if necessary.
